# Espruino Typescript Quickstart

A sample project that compiles Typescript to Espruino.

This is a fork of Andrew Wakeling's Espruino Webpack/Babel Sample project: https://github.com/andrewwakeling/espruino-webpack-babel-sample


## Setup

Install dependencies:
    
    npm i
    
Compile the project:

    npm run build

Upload the contents of `dist/app.bundle.js` to the Espruino device using the [Espruino Web IDE](https://www.espruino.com/ide/

### Disclaimer

I have not done comprehensive testing that ensures that all code is compiled or executes as expected.

If you run into any issues, please consider raising an issue here or in the [official Espriuno repository](https://github.com/espruino/Espruino).

# Thanks!

Thank you to Andrew Wakeling for his work in getting Webpack and Babel working with Espruino.
